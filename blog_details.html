                    For 15 years now, the people of Kibali in Gicumbi district and members of a community in Colorado Springs, U.S, have been united by one thing -running the race of life together, literally.

                    Located in Byumba sector, Gicumbi district in Northern Province, Kibali, like many villages in rural parts of the country, face a number of challenges, ranging from poverty in some households to lack of basic infrastructure and health facilities.

                    Sixteen years ago, the Anglican Church of Rwanda (EAR), Byumba Diocese established a relationship with the International Anglican Church of America in Colorado and they agreed to join forces to change the lives of the people of Kibali.
                    
                    As Bishop Emmanuel Ngendahayo, the Head of the Anglican Church of Rwanda (EAR), Byumba Diocese, puts it, the church through its means and connections can contribute to national development and the social wellbeing of the people, to complement what the government is doing.

                    That is exactly what they have been doing, for the past 15 years, with the members of the Anglican church in Colorado Springs, U.S, through their annual initiative ‘Run for Rwanda’, which seeks to raise money to establish community development projects in Kibali.
                  
                  ‘Run for Rwanda’ is an initiative of the Byumba EAR Diocese and the Anglican Church in Colorado Springs, U.S. The run is held annually in both countries. This year’s edition, the 15th, was held on August 6.
                  
                  “The word of God tells us that when people share the same faith and beliefs, they can do and achieve a lot together. This is what united us with our friends in Colorado and agreed to work together for the good of our people,”
                  
                  “Our engagement is guided by the principles of the Anglican church which include ministry, improving people’s lives and health. Every year we come together on the first Sunday of August to do our annual run,” Bishop Ngendahayo says.

                    With the support of friends and partners, they have been able to build a health centre in Kabali, which serves over 12,000 people and most recently they built a football pitch while a community hall, where people will be convening for different activities, is under construction.
                  
                    “Through the health centre, many people are able to access treatment of different ailments and conditions. With the sports facility, we believe that we can actually prevent the diseases if people can exercise and stay healthy and fit,” the clergyman adds.
